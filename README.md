# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

his will be the last one for today. Tomorrow we should get through about 5 practice problems before 2PM hopefully. Then we can move on. I will be keeping track of the time, your time starts as soon as i commit this file and send the message in the chat.

## Instructions

1. In a new branch called `"arithmetic"` make a new folder called `"Numbers Practice"` then make a new file, call it `"marriage.py"`.
2. This exercise is to give the age range that a certain individual can marry. To do this you must do the following.
   a. Make a variable, called it `"myAge"` and give it your age.
   b. Make a new variable called `"lower_age_limit"` - This variable must use the variable `"myAge"`, divide it by 2, and add 7.
   c. Make a new variable called `"higher_age_limit"` - This variable must use the variable `"myAge"`, multiply it by 2, and then subtract 13.
3. Lastly, print out a statement using the three variables `"myAge"`, `"lower_age_limit"`, and `"higher_age_limit"`.
   - See the example below for a sample sentence.

## Example Outputs

When I run your file with `"myAge"` being 20, I should see something like this:

- My age is 20, that means i can marry between the age of 17 and 27 years old.

When I run your file with `"myAge"` being 18, I should see something like this:

- My age is 18, that means i can marry between the age of 16 and 23 years old.

# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

Please try to keep to this time

## Instructions

1. In the branch called `"arithmetic"` inside the folder called `"Numbers Practice"` make a new file and call it `"fishing.py"`.
2. Make a variable (call it something that makes sense in this context) that holds a number. This number will be how many fish are in a pond. For example, if there are 50 fish in a pond, this variable will be 50.
3. Make another variable (call it something sensible again). This number will be how many fishes the person wants to catch. For example, if i wanted to catch 5 fish, this variable will be 5.
   - This variable must accept input from the user. (This means it must use the `input` keyword signifying it will ask the user for something)
4. Make another variable (call it something that makes sense) that hold how many fishes are left after.
   - Hint; you will use subtraction here.
5. In the end, i want you to print out a statement EXACTLY as follows where you replace the dots with the appropriate variable.
   "There were ... fishes in a pond. You caught ... fish(es). There are now ... fishes left in the pond. Happy fishing!"

## Example Outputs

When I run your file with 50 fishes in the pond initially, it should do the follow:

- How many fishes do you want to catch? 15 <-- I typed in 15 to the computer
- "There were 50 fishes in a pond. You caught 15 fish(es). There are now 35 fishes left in the pond. Happy fishing!"

# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

Please try to keep to this time

## Instructions

Go back to the "string_and_console_output" branch. We will do some more practice there.

1. In a new file called stringy.py create 10 variables, and assign them a word that is a string.
2. On each of this variables, i want you to find the length of the word using the `len()` function, and then print out each letter at each index of the word.
3. Print out the information you gathered like below.

_Note. When printing out the index letters, make sure you access them by using the index number._

## Example Outputs

When I run your file, it should do something like this:

- The word is "Ryan"!. Ryan has 4 letters. The letter at index 0 is R, index 1 is y, index 2 is a and index 3 is n. The upper case of the word is RYAN, and the lower case of the word is ryan

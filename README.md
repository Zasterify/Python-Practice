# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

Please try to keep to this time

## Instructions

1. In the branch called `"arithmetic"` inside the folder called `"Numbers Practice"` make a new file and call it `"cookie.py"`.
2. In the file, make a variable. This variable should ask the user for a the number of cookies they have in a jar.
3. Make another variable. This variable should ask the user for the number of people in the room.
4. Make a variable and save the equal division of the two numbers.
5. Make another variable and save the remainder of the division of both numbers
6. You should then print how many cookies each person can have and the remainder of the cookies after dividing them equally.

## Example Outputs

When I run your file, it should do the follow:

- How many cookies do you have? 13 <-- I typed in 13 to the computer
- How many people are in the room? 4 <-- I typed in 4 to the computer
- Each person can have 3 cookies, after that, you will have 1 cookie(s) left in the jar.

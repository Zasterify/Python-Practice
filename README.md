# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

I will be keeping track of the time, your time starts as soon as i commit this file and send the message in the chat.

## Instructions

1. Create a new branch and call it `"string_and_console_output"`
2. In this new branch create a new folder and call it `"Console Output Practice"`
3. Inside this folder, create a file and call it `"show.py"`.
4. Inside `show.py`:
   a. Print your name to the console
   b. Print where you are from
   c. Print what college you attend.

## Example Outputs

When I run your file, I should see something like this:

1.  _My name is Emmanuel Ogunjirin_
    _I am from Nigeria_
    _I attend the Univeristy of Virginia_
2.  _My name is Debo Ogunjirin_
    _I am from Nigeria_
    _I attend Gallaudet University_

# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

I will be keeping track of the time, your time starts as soon as i commit this file and send the message in the chat.

## Instructions

1. In the branch `"string_and_console_output"` find the file `"show.py"` and do the following:
   - Save your full name to a variable called `"name"`
   - Save your age to a variable called `"age"`
   - Save where you are from to a variable called `"country"`
   - Save where you go to school to a variable called `"college"`
2. Create a few sentences that use the variables above. Check out the example below.

_Notice that the items in the variables only hold the value they are assigned. This means i can change them later on and still run the same program to show a different output. Try it by putting your name, and then putting a friend's name. You will show me both of these._

## Example Outputs

When I run your file, I should see something like this:

1. _My name is Emmanuel Ogunjirin. I am 20 years old. I am from the country Nigeria, and i attend the University of Virginia_

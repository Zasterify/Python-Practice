# Damiete's Python Practice

This is where I will be typing instructions for things you should get done. As always make sure you read it
all before you start.

## Notes

##### When you are done doing your work, always make sure to merge it with the master. I will only push and pull from the master branch. You are to make the branch, do your work in the branch, and merge it back when you are ready for me to view.

##### Do not use the GitKraken to view this file. You have two options to view this file.

1. Go to your github accounts, enter the `Python Practice` then click on README.md
2. Open the `Python Practice` on your VSCode Software, click on `Extensions` and install "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Then open the README.md and click on the button to view it. - Ask me if this is confusing. I can explain since i am here for this part.

Remember to commit and push. Do NOT use generic names and numbers. Make sure the commit message makes sense about what you did. I should be able to read your commit message and understand in general what went on before you saved without ever opening the code.

## Time Limit: _1 hour_

Please try to keep to this time

## Instructions

Make a new branch and call it conditional_practice.

1. Make a new folder, call it "Conditionals" and inside make a new file and called it checking.py
2. Inside the file, two variables.
   - One of the variables should ask the user for a number.
   - The other one should hold a number
3. If the number the user puts in is the same as the number being held by the second variable the program should print "correct", otherwise, it should print "wrong".

_Note. When printing out the index letters, make sure you access them by using the index number._

## Example Outputs

When I run your file, it should do something like this:
Number i saved is 2.

- Guess a number: 4 <--- i entered 4.
- The number is wrong!

Number i saved 7

- Guess a number: 7 <-- i entered 7
- The number is right!
